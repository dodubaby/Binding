# Binding

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeremytregunna/Binding.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jeremytregunna/Binding)

There are many options for bindings in iOS, not the least of which being ReactiveCocoa. While RAC is great, and you should seriously consider using it for your applications, sometimes you need just a simple binding, and words like `flatMap`, `command` and `signal` can be intimidating for your teammates. This is why I built Binding.

The goal of Binding is to fill that spot—The "less scary"—observables spot.
